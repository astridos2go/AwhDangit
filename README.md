# AwhDangit

Picture it: after a long and gruelling 3 days collecting scrap and trying to make quota, all your teammates want to do
is gamble away your hard-earned scrap at the Casino!

With AwhDangit, gambling is much higher stakes. Lose too much money (configurable) and pay the ultimate debt!

This mod was inspired by [GamblersFallacy](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/reindogfan1372/GamblersFallacy/)
but instead tracks the net profit (or loss) from your gambling, and punishes you once you lose too much! (Better start
winning!)
